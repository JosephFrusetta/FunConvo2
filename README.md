# FunConvo2
I created FunConvo to allow anyone to text a number and get fun conversation starters based off an observation. This service uses Twilio, Render, and GPT 3.5 to provide icebreakers 24/7.

Simply text 1 (434) 404 6822 with info about the person you want to talk to. For example:

*You can even shorten your observations e.g. pirate hat
